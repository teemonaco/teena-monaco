                        <h3>Challenge</h3>
                        <p>The existing e-commerce site had a high cart abandonment rate and frequent user complaints about the checkout process. The goal was to redesign the site to improve user experience, accessibility, and conversion rates, specifically targeting an older user demographic.</p>

                        <li><strong>Prototyping:</strong>  Utilized rapid prototyping techniques to create both low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes. Conducted regular demos to stakeholders to gather feedback and iterate on designs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Implementation:</strong>  Worked closely with the development team to implement the new designs. Developed a custom framework dashboard for developers to streamline code implementation and ensure consistency. Optimized site performance by creating a custom Font Awesome kit, significantly reducing load times.</li>
